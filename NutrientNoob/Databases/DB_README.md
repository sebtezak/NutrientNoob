This folder will contain any database(s). Since GitHub will not allow me to upload such a large database, run the
"recipe_database.py" function to properly set up the "recipes.db" file locally.

Additionally, the "RAW_recipes.csv" file must be added to the project directory in the NutrientNoob folder in order to 
work properly.

Link for the recipe database:

NOTE: We only need the "RAW_recipes.csv" file for now. I don't recommend opening it because its pretty big and can slow down 
your computer. This website also contains the order in which the data is presented.
